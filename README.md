# README

This application is meant to be a starter Rails app for Mod2 students to practice CRUDing resources, and using sessions to give state to the HTTP cycle.

## Setup

To get started with this blank rails app, clone the repository and run `bundle install`.  

All of the gems you need to get started are included: rails-rspec, capybara, pry, launchy, and shoulda-matchers.

## Use

Use this blank repo to practice CRUDing resources.
* CRUD a single resource.
* CRUD two resources with a one-to-many relationship.
* CRUD two resources with a many-to-many relationship.

Currently, there are no database tables set up - you should start these resources from scratch!
